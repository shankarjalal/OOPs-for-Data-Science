    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "- OOP is a programming paradigm that models software as interacting objects — each object is an instance of a class and encapsulates state (attributes) and behavior (methods). Core benefits: modularity, reusability, easier maintenance, and better mapping to real-world concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint or template defining attributes (data) and methods (functions) for objects. It specifies how to create and operate on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class containing actual data (state) and the ability to perform operations defined by its class (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
    "- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary interfaces.\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods and restricting direct access to an object's internals (e.g., using private attributes or properties). Abstraction is what is exposed; encapsulation is how it’s protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "- \"Dunder\" = double underscore methods (e.g., _init, __str_). Also called magic/special methods; they implement special behavior and operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "- Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It supports code reuse and hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "- Polymorphism means \"many forms\": same interface/method name can work with different object types (e.g., method overriding in subclasses, duck typing in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "- Using naming conventions and access control:\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Public: attr\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Protected (convention): _attr\n",
    "\n",
    "- - Private (name-mangled): __attr\n",
    "- - Plus using @property and setter methods to control access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "- _init_ is the constructor method called when an object is created. It initializes instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "- @classmethod: receives the class (cls) as the first argument — useful for factory methods or altering class state.\n",
    "- @staticmethod: no implicit first argument — behaves like a regular function placed in the class namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "- Python does not support compile-time method overloading by signature. You can mimic overloading with default/variable args (*args, **kwargs).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "- A subclass provides a new implementation for a method defined in its superclass, enabling polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "- @property turns a method into a getter for a computed attribute. Use @<prop>.setter to define its setter. It offers controlled attribute access with attribute-like syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "- It enables code generality and extensibility: functions can operate on objects of different classes that share the same interface, improving flexibility and reducing coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "- A class that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods. In Python use abc.ABC and @abstractmethod from the abc module to define abstract classes and enforce method implementation in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "- Modularity, reusability, maintainability, easier debugging, real-world modeling, polymorphism, and encapsulation for safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Difference between a class variable and an instance variable:\n",
    "- Class variable: shared by all instances of the class.\n",
    "- Instance variable: unique to each object/instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "- A class can inherit from multiple base classes (class C(A, B):). Python resolves method lookup using the Method Resolution Order (MRO) (C3 linearization).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain _str_ and _repr_ methods in Python:\n",
    "- _repr_: meant to be an unambiguous representation, ideally valid Python expression, used for debugging.\n",
    "- _str: meant to be a readable, user-friendly string. If __str_ missing, Python uses _repr_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Significance of the super() function in Python:\n",
    "- super() returns a proxy object allowing calls to methods of a parent/superclass. Useful for cooperative multiple inheritance and to call the base class constructor/methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Significance of the _del_ method in Python:\n",
    "- _del_ is the destructor called when an object is about to be garbage-collected. Use cautiously — timing is not guaranteed and circular references may prevent calls. Prefer context managers (with) for deterministic cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod:\n",
    "- @staticmethod: no automatic self or cls. Utility functions that belong logically to the class.\n",
    "- @classmethod: automatically receives cls — can modify class state and create instances via cls().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "- A base-class reference can hold instances of subclasses; overridden methods in subclasses are called at runtime (dynamic dispatch). Python’s duck typing also enables polymorphism without inheritance if objects implement required methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "- Calling multiple methods in sequence on the same object by returning self from each method (e.g., obj.method1().method2()).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the _call_ method in Python?\n",
    "- _call_ makes an object callable like a function: obj(args) triggers obj._call_(args). Useful for function-like objects or decorators implemented as classes."
